## Quick integration

### Add dependencies in the project's pubspec.yaml

Currently, only integration through github is supported, and integration through pub is not supported yet. Add configuration in `pubspec.yaml`:

```
flutter_effect_player:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/EffectPlayer_Flutter
```

If a specific version is required, you can specify the corresponding version through the tag of the ref dependency, as shown below:

```
flutter_effect_player:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/EffectPlayer_Flutter
    ref: release_example_tag
```
